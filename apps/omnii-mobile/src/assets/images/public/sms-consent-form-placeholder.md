# SMS Consent Form Screenshot

## Required File
- **Filename**: `sms-consent-form.png`
- **Dimensions**: 400x800px (mobile screenshot aspect ratio)
- **Format**: PNG with transparency support

## Content Requirements
The screenshot should show:
1. Your app's registration/signup screen
2. A clearly visible SMS consent checkbox
3. The consent text: "I agree to receive SMS notifications from Omnii about task updates, approvals, and important account information. Message and data rates may apply. Reply STOP to opt out at any time."
4. Professional, clean UI that matches your app's design

## How to Create
1. Take a screenshot of your actual app registration flow
2. Ensure the SMS consent option is clearly visible
3. Crop to focus on the relevant consent section
4. Save as `sms-consent-form.png` in this directory
5. Update the SMS consent screen to use the real image instead of the placeholder

## Current Status
🔄 **Placeholder Active** - Replace with actual screenshot when available

The SMS consent screen currently shows a dashed border placeholder. Once you add the real screenshot file, the screen will automatically display it.
